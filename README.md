Sinco is a very lightweight browser automation and testing tool to act fast,
simple, and get the job done. What this means is, Sinco runs a subprocess for
Chrome, and will communicate to the process via the Chrome Devtools Protocol, as
the subprocess opens a WebSocket server that Sinco connects to. This allows
Sinco to spin up a new browser tab, go to certain websites, click buttons and so
much more, all programatically. All Sinco does is runs a subprocess for Chrome,
so you do not need to worry about it creating or running any other processes.

Sinco is used to run or test actions of a page in the browser. Similar to unit
and integration tests, Sinco can be used for "browser" tests.

Some examples of what you can build are:

- Browser testing for your web application
- Web scraping
- Automating interactions with a website using code

Sinco is similar to the more well-known tools that achieve the same thing, such
as Puppeteer. What sets Sinco apart is:

- It is the first Deno browser automation tool
- It does not try to install a specific Chrome version on your computer
- It is transparent: It will use the browser and version you already have
  installed.

Its maintainers have taken concepts from the following ...

- [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) â€” following a similar API and used as
  inspriration ... and mixed in their own concepts and practices such as ...

Developer UX Approachability Test-driven development Documentation-driven
development Transparency

We've tried to keep Sinco as minimal as possible, only exposing methods that
will make it easier to action upon a page. For example, setting files on a file
input. This is not a simple action so we provide a method to do this that ends
up sending multiple websocket messages.

## Documentation

### Getting Started

You use Sinco to build a subprocess (client) and interact with the page that has
been opened. This defaults to "about:blank".

```ts
import { Client } from "...";
const { browser, page } = await Client.create();
```

The hostname and port of the subprocess and debugger default to `localhost` and
`9292` respectively. If you wish to customise this, you can:

```ts
await Client.create({
  hostname: "127.0.0.1",
  debuggerPort: 1000,
});
```

Be sure to always call `.close()` on the client once you've finished any actions
with it, to ensure you do not leave any hanging ops, For example, closing after
the last `browser.*` call or before assertions.

You can also use an existing remote process and not run a new subprocess
yourself.

```ts
import { Client } from "...";
const { browser, page } = await Client.create({
  remote: true,
});
```

### Waiting for Actions (page to be loaded, requests to finish)

There is only so much we can really do on our end. Whilst we try out best to
wait for the correct events from the websocket, websites load in various ways.
Some examples might be:

- A basic website that may take 200ms to load and the DOM is fully ready by then
- A Vue site that uses Inertia or Vite. The load has loaded but the page/network
  is still fetching components

There are simple ways to handle this though

#### Wait until a specific element is visible in the page

For example if you're testing your login page, you may wait until the email
field is visible to start typing into it

```ts
import { Client } from "...";
import { delay } from "..."; // deno std

const { browser, page } = await Client.create();
const until = async (cb: () => Promise<void>) => {
  while (!(await cb())) {
    await delay(100);
  }
};
await page.location("http://localhost/login");
await until(() =>
  await page.evaluate('document.querySelector("[input=email]")')
);
await page.evaluate(() => document.querySelector("[type=email]").value = "...");
```

What this will do is you will keep calling `until`, until the result of
`evaluate` is truthy.

#### Wait until the network is idle

```ts
import { Client } from "...";
import { waitUntilNetworkIdle } from ".../src/utility.ts";

const { browser, page } = await Client.create();
await page.location("http://localhost/login");
await waitUntilNetworkIdle();
```

This method will wait until there have been 0 network requests in a 500ms
timeframe.

### Visiting Pages

You can do this by calling `.location()` on the page:

```ts
const { browser, page } = await Client.create();
await page.location("https://some-url.com");
```

### Taking Screenshots

Utilise the `.screenshot()` method on a page:

```ts
const { browser, page } = await Client.create();
await page.location("https://some-url.com");
// Defaults to jpeg, with a quality of 80
const uint8array = await page.screenshot();

const uint8array = await page.screenshot({
  format: "jpeg", // or png
  quality: 50, // 0-100, only applicable if format is optional. Defaults to 80
});

// Pass in a selector to only screenshot that
const uint8array = await page.screenshot({
  element: "div#users",
});
```

### Dialogs

You're able to interact with dialogs (prompt, alert).

```ts
const { browser, page } = await Client.create();
await page.location("https://some-url.com");
await page.dialog(false); // Decline the dialog
await page.dialog(true); // Accept it
await page.dialog(true, "I will be joining on 20/03/2024"); // Accept and provide prompt text
```

Be sure that if you're evaluating for example then calling `.dialog`, do not
await `.evaluate`, this is to ensure that the `dialog` method can get the event
of a dialog opening:

```ts
page.evaluate("...");
await page.dialog(true);
```

The method waits for av enet to tell us a dialog is opening, and once it's
opened, we will either accept or reject it with any given text if appicable

### Cookies

You can get or set cookies

```ts
const { browser, page } = await Client.create();
await page.location("https://some-url.com");
await page.cookie(); // Get the cookies, [ { ... }, { ... } ]
await page.cookie({
  name: "x-csrf-token",
  value: "1234",
  url: "/",
});
```

### Evaluating (full DOM or dev console access)

Evaluating will evaluate a command and you can use this to make any query to the
DOM, think of it like you've got the devtools open. Maybe you want to create an
element and add it to a list, or get the `innerHTML` of an element, or get the
page title.

```ts
const { browser, page } = await Client.create();
await page.location("https://some-url.com");
await page.evaluate("1 + 1"); // 2
await page.evaluate(() => {
  return document.title;
}); // "Some title"
await page.evaluate(() => {
  return document.cookie;
}); // "cxsrf=hello;john=doe"

// You can reference variables inside the callback but you must pass them as parameters, and you can pass as many as you like. See how im using `username` and `greeting` in the callback, so I can pass these in as parameters to `.evaluate()` and also access them from the callback.
await page.evaluate(
  (username, greeting) => {
    document.body.innerHTML = `${greeting}, ${username}`;
  },
  "Sinco",
  "Hello",
);
```

### Retreiving console errors

This could be useful if you would like to quickly assert the page has no console
errors. `.consoleErrors()` will return any console errors that have appeared up
until this point.

```ts
const { browser, page } = await Client.create();
await page.location("https://some-url.com");
await page.evaluate("1 + 1"); // 2
const errors = await page.consoleErrors();
```

Due to race conditions with console errors, it's best not to assert the whole
array, and instead assert the length or if it contains, for example:

```ts
const errors = await page.consoleErrors(); // ["user not defined", "undefined property company"];
// It could be that on another test run, "user not defined" is the 2nd item in the array, so instead do the below.
assertEquals(errors.length, 2);
assertEquals(errors.includes("user not defined"));
```

### Working with file inputs

We provide a simple way to set files on a file input.

```ts
const { browser, page } = await Client.create();
await page.location("https://some-url.com");
await page.setInputFiles({
  selector: "#upload",
  files: ["/home/user/images/logo.png"],
});
```

Pass in a list of files to attach to the input. You can only send 1 if your file
input sin't a multiple input

### Clicking

To click elements, you can achieve it by doing what you might do in the devtools
console:

```ts
const { browser, page } = await Client.create();
await page.location("https://some-url.com");
await page.evaluate(`document.querySelector('button[type="button"]')`);
```

If the button you click makes some form of HTTP request, be sure to utilise
`waitUntilNetworkIdle` to wait until the new page has finished loading.

If you are clicking an element that opens a new tab, be sure to use
`.newPageClick()`. This insures that we can expect a new tab to be opened and
return a new instance of `Page` for you to work with:

```ts
const { browser, page } = await Client.create();
await page.location("https://some-url.com");
const newPage = await page.newPageClick(
  `document.querySelector('button[type="button"]')`,
);
```

### Authenticating

One way of authenticating, say if there is a website that is behind a login, is
to manually set some cookies e.g., `X-CSRF-TOKEN`:

```ts
const { browser, page } = await Client.create();
await page.location("https://some-url.com/login");
const token = await page.evaluate(() =>
  document.querySelector('meta[name="token"]').value
);
await page.cookie({
  name: "X-CSRF-TOKEN",
  value: token,
});
await page.location("https://some-url.com/api/users");
```

Another approach would be to manually submit a login form:

```ts
const login = async (page: Page) => {
  await page.location("http://localhost/login");
  await until(
    async () => (await page.evaluate(
      'document.querySelector("input[type=email]")',
    )),
  );
  await page.evaluate(() => {
    document.querySelector('input[type="email"]').value = "admin@example.com";
    document.querySelector('input[type="password"]').value = "secret";
  });
  await page.evaluate(`document.querySelector('button[type=submit]')`);
};
const { browser, page } = await Client.create();
await login(page);
// Visit the required page
await page.location(url);
// Wait for the page to property load so the dom is ready
await waitUntilNetworkIdle();
// ... Assertions or actions
```
